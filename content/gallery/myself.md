## About Me

Hello! I’m Srivatsa, currently a second-year BCA student with a growing passion for technology, home lab projects, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. My curiosity has led me to experiment with a variety of operating systems, dive into self-hosting, and automate tasks around my home server.

**Skills & Technologies:**
- **Linux OS:** Arch Linux, Debian, Tails, Proxmox VE
- **Containers & Virtualization:** Docker (via Portainer), Proxmox VMs
- **Programming:** C++, Java, Python
- **Web & Networking:** nginx, basic network configuration, Tor hidden services
- **Automation:** Learning n8n, basic Bash/Python scripting
- **Databases:** Learning MySQL

## Projects & Experiments

While I am still building my public project portfolio, here are a few things I have explored in my free time:

- **Home Server Setup:** Running multiple Docker containers to self-host services.
- **Tor Hidden Service Hosting:** Set up a personal website accessible via the dark web, using nginx and Tor.
- **Tic Tac Toe Game:** Developed a simple two-player CLI game in C++.
- **Networking Experiments:** Attempted to build a custom router-—although hardware limitations made it challenging.
